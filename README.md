Day-76

Today's topic was NumPy which was wonderfully explained by Angela Yu.

What did I learn?

Create arrays manually with np.array()

Generate arrays using .arange(), .random(), and .linspace()

Analyse the shape and dimensions of a ndarray

Slice and subset a ndarray based on its indices

Do linear algebra like operations with scalars and matrix multiplication

Use NumPys broadcasting to make ndarray shapes compatible

Manipulate images in the form of ndarrays.

Project of the day

Image Processing using the above mentioned topics. You can check out my project.

Conclusion

To conclude, I would thank my instructor for being such a wonderful teacher for coming up with a beautiful course. I would like to thank MYSELF for being self-motivated throughout the lecture.
